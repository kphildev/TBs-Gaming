In 2012 a group of us got together. We wanted to create a community without abusive administrators. Our origin story, funny enough, began on Origins Mod, trying to get a scrap bus fixed. Thug had just arrived when things went south and he ended up dying protecting the scrap bus while the others, worked on finishing up repairs.  He rushed to get back ASAP and in doing so, he accidentally spawned as a female character, of which he never did. He was keeping an eye out on the horizon for any trouble headed their way. Long story short, Thug and the rest of the group perished attemping to repair and defend that scrap bus. They all decided to get back and finish the job before ending the night. Thug spawned back as a male and the rest of the gang came back as females this time, attemping to poke fun at Thug for accidentally spawning back as a female prior. As he sat upon a high point overlooking the horizon once again and watching as his group worked on the bus, he laughed. 'Thugs bitches' the actual meaning behind TBs Gaming came to be in that moment. He then coined that event as the name of the community that would follow suit. This small group of friends who gamed together wanted to build something that would bring people together for a tight knit gaming community with no childish rules or overbearing admins. Only like minded people just looking to enjoy playing the game with friends.
