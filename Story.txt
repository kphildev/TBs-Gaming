2012 a group of us got together, getting tired of abusive admins. Wanted to create a community without abusive administrators. TBs stands for Thugs Bitches. Originally on origins trying to get a scrap bus fixed. Accidentally picked a girl. He was playing overwatch and we all died. Thug spawned back as a male and the rest of the gang came back as females. Thats when it clicked for Terrance "Thug" Smith. He then coined that event as the name of the community that would follow suit. This small group of friends who gamed together wanted to build something that would bring people together for a tight knit gaming community.
