TODO list

1. Fix game page. logos misaligned and not sized correctly. responsive?

2. Begin designing color pallette for page.

3. Possibly add depth to animated gif. Looks strange having no width when rotating.

4. Add more interactivity to make page intuitive.

5. Look into adding cool features instead of plain bootstrap jquery framework.

6. Make interactive gallery (possibly just automatic smooth slideshow from the assets/images/community folder)
